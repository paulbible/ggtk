# GGTK: The GO Graph Tool Kit #{#mainpage}

A set of modular tools for working with [Gene Ontology](http://geneontology.org/) Graphs.

GGTK is composed of a set of C++ header libraries. Simply include the necessary files in your C++ source code. Some header only [Boost](http://www.boost.org) libraries are required for GGTK (Boost 1.54 or later). Using header only libraries allows scientists and developers to use as much or as little of GGTK as needed.

# Getting Started
Head over to the [GGTK Documentaiton](https://paulbible.github.io/ggtk/) page to get started.

## tl;dr
Start with the [Python Documentation](https://paulbible.github.io/ggtk/ggtk_python/index.html).

# Join the Fun!
