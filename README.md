# GGTK: The GO Graph Tool Kit # {#mainpage}
A set of modular tools for working with [Gene Ontology](http://geneontology.org/) Graphs.

GGTK is composed of a set of C++ header libraries. Simply include the necessary files in your C++ source code. Some header only [Boost](http://www.boost.org) libraries are required for GGTK (Boost 1.54 or later). Using header only libraries allows scientist and developers to use as much or as little of GGTK as needed.

# Getting Started
