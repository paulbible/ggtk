# GGTK: The GO Graph Tool Kit
A set of modular tools for working with Gene Ontology Graphs (http://geneontology.org/).

GGTK is composed of a set of C++ header libraries. Simply include the necessary files in your C++ source code. Some header only Boost libraries (www.boost.org) are required for GGTK (Boost 1.54 or later). Using header only libraries allows scientist and developers to use as much or as little of GGTK as needed.
