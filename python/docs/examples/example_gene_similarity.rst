Gene Similarity Example
=========================
Perhaps the most intersting application of sematic similarity is the calculation of gene similarity. This examples shows how to extract the set of annotations for two genes and calculate their similarity. In GGTK this is known as **Term Set Similarity**. Any set of GO terms can be used to calculate semantic similarity between sets.
